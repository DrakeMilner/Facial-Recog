# Facial-Recog
# Our facial recog device will be used to at first, be able to tell if a an object in a camera is a human or not.
# Eventually, we will want our taught AI to be able to recognize the following: Age, mood, gender, race, facial expression, and so foward.
# We plan on using our arduino kits as well as a camera paired with an AI trained using GoogleTeachable. 
# Our AI will be taught to distinguish people and be able to make deductions about a persons face, or lack thereof.
